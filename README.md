PyTorch Linear Regression Project
This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple linear regression model using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework. The goal of the project is to train a model to predict outputs based on input data with a linear relationship.

Project Components:
Data Generation: Synthetic data is generated to simulate a linear relationship between input (X) and output (y) variables.
Model Definition: A simple linear regression model is defined using PyTorch's nn.Module class, consisting of a single linear layer with learnable parameters.
Training Loop: The model is trained using a gradient descent-based optimization algorithm (SGD). The training loop iterates over multiple epochs, updating the model parameters to minimize the loss between predicted and actual values.
Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on a separate testing dataset to assess its performance on unseen data.
Model Saving: The state dictionary of the trained model is saved to a file for future use.

This project is inspired by the tutorials and resources provided by the PyTorch community. Special thanks to the contributors and maintainers of PyTorch for their valuable insights and support.
